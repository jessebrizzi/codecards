## Problem

Find the length of the longest sequence of consecutive numbers in an unsorted array. Must run in O(n) time.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [50, 3, 51, 2, 1, 4]
Output: 4  // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [10, 8, 9, 7, 6, 5, 11]
Output: 7  // [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
```

**Constraints:**
- 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
