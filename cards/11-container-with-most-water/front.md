## Problem

Find two vertical lines that form the container holding the most water.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: [3, 9, 2, 5, 7, 4]
Output: 21
Explanation: The container between heights 9 and 7 holds the most water (width=3 * height=7 = 21)
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: [6, 2, 5, 4]
Output: 10
Explanation: The container between heights 6 and 5 holds the most water (width=2 * height=5 = 10)
```

**Constraints:**
- At least 2 heights
- Heights range from 0 to 10,000
- Must run efficiently for large inputs
