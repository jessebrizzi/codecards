## Problem

Find the k most frequently occurring elements in an array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [4, 4, 4, 2, 2, 5], k = 2
Output: [4, 2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9], k = 1
Output: [7]
```

**Requirements:**
- Must run in better than O(n log n) time
- k will always be valid (1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements)
