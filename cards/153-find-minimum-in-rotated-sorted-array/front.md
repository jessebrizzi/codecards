## Problem

Find the smallest number in a rotated sorted array.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: [8, 9, 10, 2, 5, 6]
Output: 2
Explanation: The array was rotated at index 3, making 2 the smallest number
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: [15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12]
Output: 2
Explanation: The array was rotated at index 2, making 2 the smallest number
```

**Key Points:**
- Array was originally sorted in ascending order
- Rotated at some unknown pivot point
- No duplicate numbers exist
- Must run in O(log n) time complexity
